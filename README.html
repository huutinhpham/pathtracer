Path Tracer
===================================

# Overview

This project aims to render a scene. Firstly, random rays from a given camera are sampled. Then I followed each ray into the scene searching for its intersection with objects. To improve the expensive ray tracing operation, bounding-box was used to decrease the search space. Both direct, and indirection illuminations were also implemented to light up the scene. Lastly, I implemented different type of light reflections, depending on objects' materiality.
